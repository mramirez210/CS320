> How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I made sure that the code was correct, functional, and secure by making sure that the tests went through and did not use any old code that were previously used before. I doubled checked the methods that i had included and did not use any repetitions or loops that would allow attackers to come in.
> How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?


I interpreted the needs of the user by reading the requirements over and over to make sure that I understood fully. And then afterwards, i give myself a general idea on how to solve the issue and give the user the program that they need.

> How do I approach designing software?
> 
I approach design as like art. I look at the requirements like I previously said, and then I give myself a general outline on how to solve the issue. I think from previous classes I took gave me a better understanding on doing pseudocode to give myself an outline on how to solve the issue and give it better understanding by looking at it in human terms.
